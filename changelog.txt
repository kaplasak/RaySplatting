- Improved numerical stability for the pieces of code computing ray-Gaussian intersection and the modulated opacity parameter value: alpha;

- In the previous release, exceeding the maximum allowed number of Gaussians caused breaking the TRAINING process. Now it causes instead breaking the DENSIFICATION process;

- Removed the piece of code in the Win64 app, that clips the Gaussians scale parameters coefficients, since it's done in the OptiX renderer initialization function;

- Introducing the following macroparameters to the configuration file:
* Chi square squared radius for the Gaussians;
* lr_RGB final value (lr_RGB minimum clipping threshold);
* lr_alpha final value (lr_alpha minimum clipping threshold);
* lr_m final value (lr_m minimum clipping threshold);
* lr_s final value (lr_s minimum clipping threshold);
* lr_q final value (lr_q minimum clipping threshold);
