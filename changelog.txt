- Fixed the minor and infrequent bug in the gradient computation;
- Improved the memory management of the Gaussian components and the ADAM m and v vectors (2x decreased memory demand);
- Added the preprocessor definition SSIM_REDUCE_MEMORY_OVERHEAD, that allows to improve the memory management of the arrays used to compute the SSIM loss function gradient;
- Added some piece of code that allows to mix the Gaussians with the mesh geometry and performs the visualization;
