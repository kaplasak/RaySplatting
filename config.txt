(-1) Can be either "blender" or "colmap".
(0) Can be either "validation" or "training".
(1) Since application supports only 24-bit *.bmp file format, all train and test data should be converted to 24-bit *.bmp before use.
(2) Only models trained with SH degree = 0 are supported.
(3) If 0, initial parameters are obtained from pretrained model. Otherwise, they are loaded from the proprietary save file.
(4) ... relative to the value of the scene extent's norm.
(5) Evaluation is performed during every epoch congruent to <Model evaluation epoch> modulo <Model evaluation frequency>.
(6) If after gradient update we obtain in total more Gaussians than this number, we stop the densification process. Introduced to prevent the memory overrun.
